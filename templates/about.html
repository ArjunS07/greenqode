  <h1> About GreenScan </h1>

  <h3> What is GreenScan?</h3>
    
  <p> 
    GreenScan is an app that aims to help communities better understand and explore the biodiversity that exists in their community. 
    <br/><br/>
    Community managers enter details of the trees and plants into the website. They can then take a printout of a page of QR codes, arranged so that they can be cut easily, which can then be placed on the corresponding trees and plants in the community. 
    <br/><br/>
    When a community member scans the QR code using their mobile phone, they’re taken to a page on the internet showing what the community manager added.
    This means that community managers can enter details, print the QR code, then update the details without having to update the QR codes. 
    <br> <br> 

    The main advantages of using GreenScan to a community manager are:
    
    <ol> 

      <li>Information can be updated over time wiithout having to reprint the paper, since the QR code just points to a link on the internet</li>
      <li>It's more convenient for community members to read the information on a screen than having to read a printed paper that's vulnerable to damage or may be uncomfortably placed</li>
      <li>QR codes which contain the information themselves can't be updated and are limited in how much information they can store </li>
    </ol>

    <br> <br> 
    </p>
