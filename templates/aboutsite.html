            <h1>Tech Stack</h1>
            <p> This website was written in <strong> Django</strong>, a robust framework meant for building full-stack web applications in Python.
                It is hosted on a <strong> Heroku </strong> dyno, and uses a PostgreSQL database to store relational data for communities.
    
                Third-party packages and libraries used include:
    
                <ul>
    
                    <li> <strong> PyFPDF </strong> for facilitating the generation of PDFs </li>
                    <li> <strong> Firebase Storage </strong> for hosting the generated PDFs temporarily </li>
                    <li> <strong> Bulma </strong> for styling the site </li>
                    <li> <strong> Font Awesome </strong> for all the icons used in the site </li>
    
                </ul>
